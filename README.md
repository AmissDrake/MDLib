# MDLib

![v1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0.0-blue)

An easy-to-use Arduino library for controlling DC motors and omni-directional drives using 2-pin and 3-pin motor drivers.

## Features

- **Motor Driver Abstraction:** Supports both 2-pin (e.g. MD10c) and 3-pin (e.g. L298N) motor driver configurations.

- **Omni-Drive Support:** Easily control holonomic robots with 3-wheel or 4-wheel omni-directional configurations.

- **Cross-Platform:** Compatible with any Arduino-compatible microcontroller (Uno, Mega, Nano, ESP32, etc.).
